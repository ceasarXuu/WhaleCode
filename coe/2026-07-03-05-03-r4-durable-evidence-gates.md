# Problem P-001: R4 evidence gates do not reproduce on a fresh checkout

- Symptom: R4 handoff on the current `whalecode-alpha` checkout cannot reproduce all R4 evidence gates that the closeout documents cite as passing.
- Expected behavior: R4-H should leave docs, machine-readable manifests, scripts, and durable evidence in a state where lightweight R4 gates pass without depending on uncommitted run-cache directories from a previous machine.
- Actual behavior: `test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1` fails because ledger entries point at missing `target/...` run artifacts, and `test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1` fails because the default public-10 run roots are absent and the generated report has `0/10` rows.
- Impact: R4 progress cannot be handed off cleanly. Engineering fixes may exist, but R4-H evidence consistency is not currently reproducible from the repository state.
- Environment: Linux checkout at `/home/zhangxu/whalecode-alpha`, branch `whalecode-alpha`, HEAD `700cfe1`.
- Fix criteria: R4 lightweight gates must pass from the current checkout using committed docs/scripts or explicitly declared optional external run roots; generated target evidence must state whether it validates a durable snapshot or live run directories.
- Current conclusion: investigating.

# Hypothesis H-001: R4 ledger records ephemeral target run paths as required repository evidence

- Claim: `docs/v0.0.5/build-R4/r4-sample-evidence-ledger.json` uses `target/...` runtime artifacts as `primary_evidence` and `secondary_evidence`; those files are not committed, so the gate fails even though durable CoE or docs evidence exists.
- Prediction: The ledger gate will report missing `target/...` files, while at least some cited CoE/doc evidence paths exist in the repository.
- Diagnostic evidence plan: Run `test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1`, inspect the generated evidence JSON, and compare missing paths against ledger references.
- Status: confirmed.

# Evidence E-001: R4 sample ledger gate fails on missing target evidence paths

- Prediction tested: H-001 predicts missing `target/...` evidence paths.
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1`
- Result: failed.
- Key output: `primary_evidence missing for r3-rerun-single-file-fast-fix-positive-control: target/r3-tool-feedback-rerun-single-file-20260630-0343/single-file-fast-fix/20260630-034332-008/pair-001/pair-report.md`
- Generated evidence: `target/r4-sample-ledger/r4-sample-ledger-evidence.json`
- Evidence detail: generated evidence records `sample_count=12`, `failure_count=19`, with failures concentrated in missing `target/...` primary and secondary evidence files.
- Interpretation: The gate behavior matches H-001.

# Evidence E-002: The ledger requires repository-local evidence paths

- Prediction tested: H-001 predicts the validator checks evidence paths as repository-local files.
- Source: `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1`
- Observation: `Test-RepoPath` joins each evidence path to `$repoRoot` and requires `Test-Path -PathType Leaf`.
- Interpretation: Any ledger entry pointing to an uncommitted `target/...` run artifact will fail on a fresh checkout.

# Hypothesis H-002: R4 public-10 usage accounting gate has no durable good-report fixture

- Claim: `test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1` tries to generate its good report from default Windows run roots before testing accounting invariants. Without those run roots, the accounting gate fails on missing input artifacts instead of exercising the intended positive and negative report checks.
- Prediction: The usage gate will invoke `write-r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.ps1 -RequireComplete`, which fails with `0/10 found` on the current checkout.
- Diagnostic evidence plan: Run the usage accounting gate and inspect the script call path.
- Status: confirmed.

# Evidence E-003: Public-10 usage accounting gate fails before invariant checks

- Prediction tested: H-002 predicts `0/10 found` report generation failure.
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1`
- Result: failed.
- Key output: `R4 public-10 report incomplete: 0/10 found; missing: vim-terminal-task, heterogeneous-dates, sqlite-db-truncate, git-multibranch, git-workflow-hack, organization-json-generator, sqlite-with-gcov, processing-pipeline, csv-to-parquet, tmux-advanced-workflow`
- Interpretation: The script cannot reach its intended accounting mismatch checks without the external run directories.

# Evidence E-004: Public-10 report writer defaults to non-repository Windows run roots

- Prediction tested: H-002 predicts default roots outside the repository.
- Source: `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/write-r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.ps1`
- Observation: when `-RunRoots` is omitted, the script scans `C:\WhaleRunCache\r4-public10-20260701\actual` and `C:\WhaleRunCache\r4-public10-20260702\actual`.
- Interpretation: The public-10 report generation path is valid on the original Windows run host, but not as a fresh-checkout reproducibility gate.

# Hypothesis H-003: Durable docs/CoE evidence plus a public-10 snapshot can restore fresh-checkout R4-H gates

- Claim: R4-H reproducibility can be restored without fabricating raw run artifacts by changing required ledger evidence to repository-local durable docs/CoE paths, preserving original run paths as archived references, and using a committed public-10 report snapshot for accounting-gate shape and negative mutation checks.
- Prediction: After the repair, `test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1`, `test-r4-public-10-tool-stress-plan.ps1 -ReportPath docs/v0.0.5/build-R4/r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.snapshot.json`, and `test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1` pass on the current checkout.
- Diagnostic evidence plan: Implement the durable evidence repair, then run the three gates above and record their outputs.
- Status: confirmed.

# Evidence E-005: R4 sample ledger gate passes after durable evidence repair

- Prediction tested: H-003 predicts the sample ledger gate passes after replacing required missing target evidence with durable docs/CoE evidence.
- Repair artifacts: `docs/v0.0.5/build-R4/r4-sample-evidence-ledger.json`
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-sample-ledger.ps1`
- Result: passed.
- Key output: `R4 sample ledger gate passed: 12 samples`
- Interpretation: The fresh checkout now has repository-local evidence for every ledger row while retaining historical run paths under archived fields.

# Evidence E-006: Public-10 snapshot passes the public sample report gate

- Prediction tested: H-003 predicts the durable snapshot satisfies public-10 report-shape validation.
- Repair artifacts: `docs/v0.0.5/build-R4/r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.snapshot.json`
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-tool-stress-plan.ps1 -ReportPath docs/v0.0.5/build-R4/r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.snapshot.json`
- Result: passed.
- Key output: `R4 public-10 tool-stress gate passed: 10 planned samples`
- Interpretation: Public sample membership and required report fields are now verifiable from committed artifacts.

# Evidence E-007: Usage accounting gate passes without external run roots

- Prediction tested: H-003 predicts the usage accounting gate can exercise good-report and bad-report checks from the durable snapshot.
- Repair artifacts: `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1`
- Command: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1`
- Result: passed.
- Key output: `PASS: R4 public-10 usage accounting gate rejects ambiguous token usage`
- Interpretation: The gate now validates accounting semantics on fresh checkout instead of failing before the intended invariant checks.

# Hypothesis H-004: public-10 report drops timeout-side rollout token usage

- Claim: A timed-out side can still have `rollout_trace_*_tokens` flushed through `token_count` events, but `write-r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.ps1` only used top-level `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` for token ratios and usage status.
- Prediction: A synthetic pair with missing top-level token summary and present rollout trace token counts will be reported as token usage unavailable before the repair, even though partial usage is recoverable.
- Diagnostic evidence plan: Build a synthetic public-10 pair for `heterogeneous-dates` with only rollout trace token fields, run the report writer, and require `token_ratio_availability=recovered_from_rollout_trace`.
- Status: confirmed.

# Evidence E-008: rollout token fallback is now covered by the usage accounting gate

- Prediction tested: H-004 predicts a synthetic timeout pair can recover token ratio from rollout trace token counts.
- Repair artifacts:
  - `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/write-r4-public-10-tool-stress-report.ps1`
  - `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-tool-stress-plan.ps1`
  - `scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1`
- Command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/taskspace-benchmark/test-r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate.ps1`
- Result: passed.
- Key output:
  ```text
  R4 public-10 report written: target/r4-public-10-usage-accounting-gate/rollout-token-fallback-report.json
  complete_run_count=1 missing_run_count=9
  PASS: R4 public-10 usage accounting gate rejects ambiguous token usage
  ```
- Matched signal:
  - Synthetic `heterogeneous-dates` row reports `token_ratio_availability=recovered_from_rollout_trace`.
  - `taskspace_token_ratio=3`.
  - standard and TaskSpace usage statuses are `recovered_from_rollout_trace`.
- Interpretation:
  - Timeout rows no longer have to collapse to fully unavailable cost evidence when rollout `token_count` events survived the process timeout.
  - This is a report/accounting repair, not TaskSpace utility parity evidence.
