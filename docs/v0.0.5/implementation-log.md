# v0.0.5 Implementation Log

## 2026-06-17 Phase 0 instrumentation baseline start

Changed:

- Added benchmark cost instrumentation artifact generation.
- `metrics.json` now links to `token-summary.json`, `request-summary.json`, and `taskspace-control-usage.json`.
- Missing usage data is reported as unavailable or partial, never as zero.
- `taskspace_control` action counts are parsed from execution JSONL arguments.
- Thin TaskSpace runs with few nodes and no `spawn_agent` no longer emit `thin_mode_violation` by default.

Validation:

```text
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\taskspace-benchmark\test-harness.ps1 -RunRoot target\paired-bench-selftest-v005-phase0-348b7a2c
TaskSpace benchmark harness self-test: PASS
```

Notes:

- The first failed run exposed a real artifact writer issue: missing output directories must be created before writing cost summaries.
- Reusing a self-test run root can trip old harness assumptions; use a fresh run root for deterministic local validation.
- The harness had one stale relative-vs-absolute path assertion for latest run discovery; the assertion now compares resolved paths.

Remaining Phase 0 work:

- Produce a focused E3 smoke pair with the new artifacts.
- Add suite or sample-level aggregation for the new token/request/control usage artifacts.
- Replace replay detection heuristics with model-visible prompt/history reconstruction once the active profile work starts.
